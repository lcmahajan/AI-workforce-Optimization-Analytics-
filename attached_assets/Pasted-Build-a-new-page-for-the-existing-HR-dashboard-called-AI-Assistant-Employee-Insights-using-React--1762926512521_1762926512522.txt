Build a new page for the existing HR dashboard called AI Assistant — Employee Insights using React + Tailwind CSS. Place it under the Optimization section.

The page must provide a fast, secure, role-aware (Admin / Manager / Editor) AI assistant and search that returns a full employee profile and actionable recommendations. Use modular components and prepare placeholders for real AI integration (OpenAI or other LLM) and a vector DB. The page should work with dummy/static data initially, but should be clearly structured for data upload / API integration later.

Top-level UI / Layout

Left: small vertical breadcrumb / nav (Optimization → AI Assistant)

Center: Search bar at top (placeholder: “Search employee by name or userID…”) with quick filters (Department, Role).

Right: Role selector (Admin / Manager / Editor) for demo (simulate access control).

Main area: split into two columns on wide screens:

Left column (60%): Employee detail panel + timeline + process/activity list + charts.

Right column (40%): AI Assistant chat box + quick facts card + recommended actions & suggested trainings.

Search behavior (UI)

User types name or userid → immediate dropdown results (mock data).

On select, load full employee profile into the detail panel and send a structured prompt to the AI assistant (mock LLM) to produce: summary, status, recommendations, and flags.

Provide a “Refresh Insights” button to re-run analysis on current data.

Employee Detail Panel (show all fields)

Header with avatar, Name, UserID, Position, Department, Current Role, Recommended Role, Joining Date, Email, Salary, Experience (years).

Key metric chips: Fitment Score (value + classification: Fit/Unfit/Train to Fit/Overfit), Productivity Rate (%), Utilization (%), FTE (FTE optimization suggestion), Consolidated / Non-Consolidated (counts), Skill Score, Aptitude Score, Consolidation Rate, Automation Potential (Low/Medium/High).

Tabs: Overview | Activities (processes worked on) | Skills & Gaps | Performance Timeline | Documents.

Activities tab: list processes the employee works on (process name, time spent, output), with ability to mark process as candidate for automation.

Charts & Visuals

Small line chart for Productivity over time (dummy data).

Bar chart for skill scores (hard vs soft skills).

Pie or donut for consolidated vs non-consolidated work. (Use simple SVG or Chart library placeholder.)

AI Assistant panel

Chatbox UI with system / assistant / user messages.

On employee load, assistant auto-generates a structured summary card with:

One-sentence profile summary (role, tenure, top skills).

Fitment verdict and reasoning.

Productivity & utilization highlights.

Automation potential and recommended processes to automate.

Recommended learning/training (softskills/hardskills).

Suggested HR actions (promote, train, reassign, performance plan).

Provide query examples buttons below the chat (Quick queries):

“Why is this employee Train to Fit?”

“List 3 recommended trainings.”

“Show last 6 months productivity.”

“Which processes to automate for this employee?”

Include an “Export Report (PDF)” placeholder button.

RBAC & Data visibility

Simulate role-based views:

Admin: sees everything (salary, email, recommendations).

Manager: sees performance, fitment, process, recommendations, contact (no salary if flagged).

Editor: sees role/skill/fitment but limited confidential fields.

Add a visible badge showing current demo role and hide/blur restricted fields when role lacks access.

Data & Automation logic (client-side mock)

Include a small mock dataset (JSON) with multiple employees containing all fields: userid, name, email, salary, joiningDate, department, position, currentRole, recommendedRole, fitmentScore, productivity, utilization, processes [{name, hours, output}], skills {soft:[], hard:[]}, skillScore, aptitudeScore, consolidated boolean, automationPotential score, experienceYears, documents.

On load, parse data into state; on search select populate UI.

Implement auto-calculations:

Fitment classification: Fit ≥8, Train 5–7, Unfit <5, Overfit >9 (example).

Average productivity, top/bottom processes, FTE optimization estimate = (current hours / expected hours).

Automation potential: derived from process repetitive score and time spent (mock logic).

Implement simple highlight rules (top performers green, at-risk red).

AI Assistant Implementation (mock + integration hooks)

Build the assistant to work in two modes:

Mock mode (default): use deterministic JS functions to compose assistant replies from the loaded employee object (good for offline demo).

LLM mode (placeholder): include a helper function callAI(prompt, metadata) that posts to /api/ai (placeholder) — documented so developer can swap with OpenAI / other LLM easily.

Include prompt templates for real LLM usage, e.g.:

SYSTEM: You are an HR analytics assistant. Use the employee data JSON and answer concisely. Provide:
- short_profile, fitment_verdict, reasons, productivity_summary, automation_candidates, training_recommendations, HR_action_suggestions.
USER: Analyze this employee: {employeeJSON}


Provide function that converts assistant output into UI cards and suggested actions.

Security & Privacy notes (UI display)

When role !== Admin, blur/hide salary & sensitive fields and show “Restricted”.

Add an audit log placeholder when Manager downloads/export report.

Extras

Add keywords tagging (e.g., “high-risk”, “automation-candidate”).

Allow manager to add a note/comment stored in local state.

Add a small “Fatigue” indicator computed from recent activity hours (mock).

Styling

Use Tailwind. Keep consistent with the rest of the dashboard (cards, shadows, rounded corners).

Use color-coded chips for Fitment (green/orange/red/blue) but include accessible labels so blur users can read text.

Deliverables

Single-file React page AiEmployeeAssistant.jsx plus a small mockData.js with sample employees.

Clear comments where to integrate real AI keys, vector DB and backend.

Demo-ready: works client-only with mock data and simulated AI replies.

End Goal: A production-prototype AI assistant page that helps Admin/Manager/Editor instantly get full employee context and recommended HR actions via an AI-generated summary and interactive chat.

⚙️ Quick Implementation Notes (so the generated code is useful)

Mock AI: The assistant should first be implemented with JS templates (deterministic) so you can demo instantly without API keys. Example: it reads fitmentScore and productivity and returns natural-language summary + structured JSON fields.

Production AI: Hook callAI() to OpenAI (or other LLM) and pass the structured prompt + employeeJSON. For long-term, use embeddings + vector DB for historical documents and more context-aware answers.

Vector DB idea: store employee documents, process logs, reviews as vectors; when manager asks complex questions (e.g., “what did he do in Q2?”), query vectors for supporting docs and pass to LLM.

Security: Use RBAC on backend; never send salary or PII to LLM unless redaction and consent is handled.

Export/Share: generate a PDF summary server-side for audit trail.

💡 Sample AI Assistant Response Template (for your mock mode)

When a manager searches userid: EMP123 assistant returns:

Profile Summary:
"Ramesh Kumar (EMP123), Senior Analyst in Finance, joined 2019 (6.2 yrs). Top skills: Reconciliation, Excel, SQL. Fitment Score: 6.8 — Train to Fit (gap in automation scripting)."

Performance:
"Productivity: 72% average last 6 months; Utilization: 85%. Major processes: Vendor Reconciliation (45% time), Monthly Close (20%)."

FTE Optimization / Automation Potential:
"Automation Potential: High for Vendor Reconciliation — repetitive steps + high time share. Estimate: save 0.6 FTE if automated."

Recommendations:
"- Short-term: Enroll in ‘Advanced Excel & RPA Basics’ (2 weeks).

Medium-term: Pair with automation specialist to document process for RPA.

HR Action: Consider ‘Train to Fit’ targeted program; monitor 3 months post-training."

Suggested Manager Actions:
"[Add Training Plan] [Flag for Automation Review] [Schedule 1:1]"
